      <p>The purpose of this study, which is part of a larger research project, is to investigate the impact of media on attention. In this study, some participants received a video to watch while they performed an attention task. Our goal is to determine whether the opportunity to engage with media influences one’s ability to remain attentive and assessments of their current experience.</p>
      <p>The task you completed, the n-back, is a behavioural index of one’s ability to remain attentive. The video shown in this study of the Keith Barry: Brain Magic TED Talk (https://www.ted.com/talks/keith_barry_does_brain_magic). Furthermore, during the study session we asked you report upon your level of boredom, motivation, and concentration. Responses to these items will allow us to qualify any behavioural outcomes with subjective experiences.</p>
      <p>Please remember that data, with no personal identifiers, collected from this study will be maintained on a password-protected computer database in the Department of Psychology at the University of Waterloo. As well, the data will be electronically archived after completion of the study, maintained for a minimum of 7 years. Upon completion of this study, de-identified data may be deposited in an online public repository/database. Identifying information will not appear in any report, publication, or presentation resulting from the study. This process is integral to the research process as it allows other researchers to verify results and avoid duplicating research. Other individuals may access these data by accessing the open access repository. Although the dataset without identifiers may be shared publicly, your identity will always remain confidential.</p>
      <p>If you are interested in learning the outcome of the study, or if you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to email any of the researchers involved in the study at any time. Eventually, the conclusions of this study will be shared with the research community through seminars, conferences, presentations, and journal articles. Results are estimated to be available by the end of December 2018.</p>
